# Ember Flask Project Base

This project is used as a base for many of my Ember.js & Rails projects.
This was inspired by [Ember Rails Project Base](https://github.com/bahudso/ember-rails-project-base)

## Backend
TBD

## Frontend
The Ember.js frontend uses [ember-cli-simple-auth-devise](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-cli-simple-auth-devise) for local session management.

#### Versions
* [Ember-Cli 0.1.1](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli)
* [Ember-cli-bootstrap 0.0.12](https://github.com/dockyard/ember-cli-bootstrap)
